# C0-Virtual-Machine  

This is my project for the third-semester **Imperative Programming** class at CMU.  

**C0** is a small, safe subset of C designed for teaching programming and computer systems, featuring simplified syntax and automatic memory management.  

## Project Introduction: C0VM  

**C0VM** is a minimalist, stack-based virtual machine for the C0 language, inspired by the JVM and LLVM but intentionally simplified (e.g., no bytecode verification). I implemented a bytecode interpreter in C that executes arbitrary C0 programs, managing the operand stack, call frames, memory and array operations, and control flow.  

Building C0VM required explicit low-level data and memory manipulation, which not only demonstrated practical use cases for C but also deepened my understanding of how C0 (and by extension, C) programs are executed under the hood.
